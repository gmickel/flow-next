# Ralph init

Scaffold or update repo-local Ralph harness. Opt-in only.

## Preamble

## Pre-check: Local setup version

Compare `.flow/meta.json` `setup_version` to the plugin version; on mismatch, escalate once per plugin version. Fail-open throughout: a missing `jq`, `.flow/meta.json`, or plugin manifest silently continues.

```bash
SETUP_VER=$(jq -r '.setup_version // empty' .flow/meta.json 2>/dev/null)
PLUGIN_JSON="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.codex}}/.codex-plugin/plugin.json"
PLUGIN_VER=$(jq -r '.version' "$PLUGIN_JSON" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
VERSION_ACK=$(jq -r '.version_ack // empty' .flow/meta.json 2>/dev/null)
if [[ -n "$SETUP_VER" && "$PLUGIN_VER" != "unknown" && "$SETUP_VER" != "$PLUGIN_VER" ]]; then
 if [[ "${FLOW_RALPH:-}" == "1" || -n "${REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH:-}" \
 || "${FLOW_AUTONOMOUS:-}" == "1" || "${ARGUMENTS:-}" == *mode:autonomous* \
 || "$VERSION_ACK" == "$PLUGIN_VER" ]]; then
 echo "Local setup v${SETUP_VER} differs from plugin v${PLUGIN_VER}. Run /flow-next:setup to refresh local scripts." >&2
 else
 echo "FLOW_SETUP_ASK ${SETUP_VER} ${PLUGIN_VER}"
 fi
fi
```

**Ask the user via plain text.** Render the options below as a numbered list `1.` … `N.`, followed by a final option `N+1. Other — type your own answer`. Print the question, then the numbered list, then **stop and wait for the user's next message before continuing**. Parse the reply as: a bare number `1`–`N+1` → that option; the literal text of an option label → that option; free text after `Other` → custom answer.

If the block printed a `FLOW_SETUP_ASK` line, before proceeding ask the user with plain-text numbered prompt (local setup differs from the plugin; refresh now?), offering exactly the options **Refresh now**, **Remind me next version**, **Skip this run**, then continue the skill whichever is chosen:
- **Refresh now**: pause and have the user run `/flow-next:setup` in this session (do not run setup yourself), then continue once it finishes.
- **Remind me next version**: record the acknowledgement so this version is not re-asked (only a later plugin version re-arms it), then continue. Run this self-contained write (fail-open: on any error, continue anyway):
 ```bash
 PJ="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.codex}}/.codex-plugin/plugin.json"
 PV=$(jq -r '.version' "$PJ" 2>/dev/null)
 [[ -n "$PV" && "$PV" != "null" ]] && rm -f .flow/meta.json.tmp && jq --arg v "$PV" '.version_ack = $v' .flow/meta.json > .flow/meta.json.tmp && mv .flow/meta.json.tmp .flow/meta.json
 ```
- **Skip this run**: continue without writing anything; the next invocation asks again.

Any other output (the one-line differs notice, or nothing) is non-blocking: continue.

The plugin root resolves once via the cross-platform env-var fallback (Droid uses `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT`; Claude Code documents `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` as its compat alias). Subsequent blocks use `$PLUGIN_ROOT`:

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="$HOME/.codex"
```

## Rules

- Only create/update `scripts/ralph/` in the current repo.
- If `scripts/ralph/` already exists, offer to update (preserves config.env).
- Copy templates from `templates/` into `scripts/ralph/` (includes `ralphctl.py` for pause/resume/stop/status).
- Copy `flowctl`, `flowctl.cmd`, `flowctl.py` (from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/`) and `pick-python.sh` (from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/lib/`) into `scripts/ralph/` — flat, so the resolver lands at `scripts/ralph/pick-python.sh` (NOT `scripts/ralph/lib/`) where `ralph.sh` and the hook wrapper source it.
- Set executable bit on `scripts/ralph/ralph.sh`, `scripts/ralph/ralph_once.sh`, `scripts/ralph/flowctl`, and `scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py`.
- **Hook registration is agent-driven skill prose only.** The plugin ships ZERO hooks by default. You (the host agent) merge the guard entries into the project's host settings via Read+Edit. Never clobber unrelated hooks. Idempotent on re-run. **HARD BOUNDARY: no flowctl subcommand for hook install/remove/status — zero hook machinery in Python.**

## Workflow

1. Resolve repo root: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

2. Check if `scripts/ralph/` exists:
 - If exists: ask "Update existing Ralph setup? (preserves config.env and runs/) [y/n]"
 - If no: stop
 - If yes: set UPDATE_MODE=1
 - If not exists: set UPDATE_MODE=0

3. Detect available review backends (skip if UPDATE_MODE=1):
 ```bash
 HAVE_RP=$(which rp-cli >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo 1 || echo 0)
 HAVE_CODEX=$(which codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo 1 || echo 0)
 HAVE_COPILOT=$(which copilot >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo 1 || echo 0)
 HAVE_CURSOR=$(which cursor-agent >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo 1 || echo 0)
 ```

4. Determine review backend (skip if UPDATE_MODE=1):
 - If MULTIPLE available, ask user. Only
 show the options whose CLIs were detected:
 ```
 Multiple review backends available. Which one?
 a) RepoPrompt (macOS, visual builder)
 b) Codex CLI (cross-platform, GPT 5.5 High)
 c) GitHub Copilot CLI (cross-platform, Claude/GPT via Copilot)
 d) Cursor CLI (cross-platform, runs cursor-agent; gpt-5.5-high via Cursor subscription)

 (Reply: "a", "rp", "b", "codex", "c", "copilot", "d", "cursor", or just tell me)
 ```
 Wait for response. Default if empty/ambiguous: prefer `rp` > `codex` > `copilot` > `cursor`.
 - If only rp-cli available: use `rp`
 - If only codex available: use `codex`
 - If only copilot available: use `copilot`
 - If only cursor-agent available: use `cursor`
 - If none available: use `none`

5. Copy files using bash (MUST use cp, NOT Write tool):

 **If UPDATE_MODE=1 (updating):**
 ```bash
 # Backup config.env
 cp scripts/ralph/config.env /tmp/ralph-config-backup.env

 # Update templates (preserves runs/)
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/ralph.sh" scripts/ralph/
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/ralph_once.sh" scripts/ralph/
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/prompt_plan.md" scripts/ralph/
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/prompt_work.md" scripts/ralph/
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/prompt_completion.md" scripts/ralph/
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/watch-filter.py" scripts/ralph/
 cp "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/ralphctl.py" scripts/ralph/
 cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/flowctl" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/flowctl.cmd" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/flowctl.py" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/lib/pick-python.sh" scripts/ralph/
 mkdir -p scripts/ralph/hooks
 cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/hooks/ralph-guard.py" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/hooks/ralph-guard" scripts/ralph/hooks/
 chmod +x scripts/ralph/ralph.sh scripts/ralph/ralph_once.sh scripts/ralph/flowctl scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard.py scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard

 # Restore config.env
 cp /tmp/ralph-config-backup.env scripts/ralph/config.env
 ```

 **If UPDATE_MODE=0 (fresh install):**
 ```bash
 mkdir -p scripts/ralph/runs scripts/ralph/hooks
 cp -R "~/.codex/templates/flow-next-ralph-init/." scripts/ralph/
 cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/flowctl" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/flowctl.cmd" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/flowctl.py" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/lib/pick-python.sh" scripts/ralph/
 cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/hooks/ralph-guard.py" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/hooks/ralph-guard" scripts/ralph/hooks/
 chmod +x scripts/ralph/ralph.sh scripts/ralph/ralph_once.sh scripts/ralph/flowctl scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard.py scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard
 ```
 Note: `cp -R templates/.` copies all files including dotfiles (.gitignore).

6. Edit `scripts/ralph/config.env` to set the chosen review backend (skip if UPDATE_MODE=1):
 - Replace `PLAN_REVIEW={{PLAN_REVIEW}}` with `PLAN_REVIEW=<chosen>`
 - Replace `WORK_REVIEW={{WORK_REVIEW}}` with `WORK_REVIEW=<chosen>`
 - Replace `COMPLETION_REVIEW={{COMPLETION_REVIEW}}` with `COMPLETION_REVIEW=<chosen>`

7. **Register project hooks (agent-driven; required for the guard to fire).**

 Detect host (same signals as `/flow-next:setup` Step 0 when available; otherwise probe the settings paths below). Then **Read** the target file, **merge** the flow-next Ralph guard entries, **Edit/Write** the result. Never replace the whole hooks object with only our entries. Idempotent: if an entry's `command` already contains `scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard`, leave that matcher group alone (or refresh the command string to the canonical form below if it drifted).

 **Fingerprint** for "this is a flow-next Ralph guard entry": the hook `command` string contains `scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard` (wrapper and/or `.py` fallback).

 **Canonical guard command** (same on every host that can run bash wrappers):

 ```
 if [ -f scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard ]; then bash scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard; elif [ -f scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard.py ]; then scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard.py; fi
 ```

 Timeout: `5` seconds. Type: `command`.

 ### Claude Code → merge into `.claude/settings.json`

 Target: project file `.claude/settings.json` (create `{"hooks":{}}` skeleton if missing; preserve every non-hooks key).

 Merge these four event groups under `hooks` (Claude schema). Matchers use regex OR so Droid interop and Claude share one entry shape:

 | Event | Matcher | Notes |
 |---|---|---|
 | `PreToolUse` | `Bash\|Execute` | shell |
 | `PreToolUse` | `Edit\|Write` | file tools (Claude names; Droid file tools extended in guard body later) |
 | `PostToolUse` | `Bash\|Execute` | shell |
 | `Stop` | *(no matcher)* | stop gate |
 | `SubagentStop` | *(no matcher)* | subagent stop gate |

 Each event's array entry is one matcher group with a single hook object `{type, command, timeout}` using the canonical command above.

 **Consent gate:** Claude Code's project-hooks trust prompt is the human consent surface. Do not invent a second consent ceremony. After merge, tell the user they may need to accept/trust project hooks in the host UI for them to load this session.

 ### Factory Droid → merge into `.factory/hooks.json`

 Target (verified against Factory hooks-reference): project file **`.factory/hooks.json`**. Prefer that path. Fallback only if the project already stores hooks under the `hooks` key of `.factory/settings.json` and has no `.factory/hooks.json` — merge there instead; never invent a third path.

 Same four event groups and matchers as Claude (`Bash|Execute`, `Edit|Write`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`). Factory's canonical shell tool is `Execute` (the `Bash|Execute` regex still matches). File-tool names on Droid also include `Create` / `ApplyPatch` — matchers may stay `Edit|Write` for this install shape; the guard body accepts the broader set when that lands (section C of the parent spec).

 Prefer project-relative command as above (Ralph harness is repo-local). If the host requires absolute paths, rewrite with `"$FACTORY_PROJECT_DIR"/scripts/ralph/hooks/...` but keep the same fingerprint substring `scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard`.

 ### Codex → write/merge project `.codex/hooks.json`

 Codex has no Claude-schema plugin hooks auto-load from the marketplace plugin. Project scope is `.codex/hooks.json`.

 Codex subset (no `SubagentStop`; no `Edit`/`Write` matchers — Codex only intercepts shell):

 | Event | Matcher |
 |---|---|
 | `PreToolUse` | `Bash\|Execute` |
 | `PostToolUse` | `Bash\|Execute` |
 | `Stop` | *(no matcher)* |

 Top-level JSON must be **only** `{"hooks":{...}}` — no sibling `description` key (Codex rejects unknown fields and disables all hooks).

 If `.codex/config.toml` exists, ensure exactly one `hooks = true` under `[features]` (drop deprecated `codex_hooks`). Same normalization intent as setup's historical Codex hooks step; do it with a careful edit, not a second copy of setup's python block unless you need it.

 ### Cursor / Grok

 - **Cursor:** Ralph hooks are unsupported (Cursor hook schema is `afterFileEdit` / `beforeShellExecution`). Scaffold `scripts/ralph/` only; print that the guard will not fire on Cursor; do not invent a Cursor-format hook file.
 - **Grok Build:** reads Claude-compat plugin/project surfaces; use the Claude Code path (`.claude/settings.json`).

 ### Re-run / update

 On UPDATE_MODE=1 still re-merge hooks so a project that had scaffold but lost settings entries is repaired. Skip only when every required event already has a fingerprinted entry with the canonical command.

8. Print next steps (run from terminal, NOT inside the agent session):

 **If UPDATE_MODE=1:**
 ```
 Ralph updated! Your config.env was preserved.

 Hooks: project settings were re-merged (idempotent). Accept the host's
 project-hooks trust prompt if it appears.

 Run from terminal:
 - ./scripts/ralph/ralph_once.sh (one iteration, observe)
 - ./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh (full loop, AFK)
 - ./scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py status|pause|resume|stop (run control; not flowctl)
 ```

 **If UPDATE_MODE=0:**
 ```
 Ralph initialized!

 Next steps (run from terminal, NOT inside the agent session):
 - Accept project-hooks trust if the host prompts (required once)
 - Edit scripts/ralph/config.env to customize settings
 - ./scripts/ralph/ralph_once.sh (one iteration, observe)
 - ./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh (full loop, AFK)
 - ./scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py status|pause|resume|stop (run control; not flowctl)

 Maintenance:
 - Re-run /flow-next:ralph-init after plugin updates to refresh scripts + re-merge hooks
 - Uninstall: /flow-next:uninstall removes hook entries; then manually rm -rf scripts/ralph/ if desired
 ```
