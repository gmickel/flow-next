# GitHub adapter — transport via `gh` (headless-safe, reduced-fidelity status)

The GitHub implementation of the six-method transport interface
([adapter-interface.md](adapter-interface.md)). GitHub-next per the staging
decision (Linear first — [linear-ladder.md](linear-ladder.md) — GitHub second,
the **headless-robust** path). This is the transport behind the fn-52.2 adapter
interface; it reuses the fn-52.4/.5 reconcile core **unchanged** — proving the
reconciliation is transport-blind (the R13 guarantee). It mirrors the Linear
adapter's shape, but GitHub has **one** transport (`gh`), so there is no
multi-rung ladder — only a single rung plus the terminal no-op.

| Rung | Transport | Use when | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **`gh` CLI** (headless via `GH_TOKEN`) | `gh auth status` exits 0 (a token is reachable) | the only GitHub transport; scriptable, version-stable JSON |
| 2 (terminal) | **no-op + receipt note** | `gh` not installed OR `gh auth status` non-zero | the bridge is configured but no GitHub transport is reachable |

The chosen rung is recorded on every receipt: `sync receipt … --transport gh|none`
— plus, on a lifecycle run, the touchpoint it served: `${EVENT:+--event "$EVENT"}`
(`$EVENT` is set in steps.md Phase 0; empty on manual runs, so the flag is omitted).
The agentic reconciliation (fn-52.4 body merge, fn-52.5 status/comments) is
**identical regardless of tracker** — that is the R13 guarantee, and the parity
check below (vs the Linear adapter) is how it is verified.

> **Why `gh` and not the GraphQL/REST API directly.** `gh` is the headless,
> auth-managed analog of Linear's GraphQL rung: `GH_TOKEN` for non-interactive
> auth, stable `--json` output, no OAuth dance to script. It is the
> headless/CI/Ralph-safe path (GitHub has no MCP-vs-headless split like Linear —
> `gh` covers both interactive and headless), which is why GitHub is the
> headless-robust tracker shipped second.

## Rung detection (probe, don't assume)

Detection lives in the skill (host agent), not in flowctl — same shape as fn-51's
driver ladder and the Linear ladder. Probe; take the rung that passes:

```bash
# Rung 1 — gh reachable + authenticated. `gh auth status` exits 0 when a token
# (incl. GH_TOKEN) resolves for the host; non-zero when unauthenticated. The
# discovery probe in SKILL.md uses this same signal.
if command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1 && gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
 TRANSPORT=gh
fi

# Rung 2 — neither reachable:
# TRANSPORT=none → every interface method is a documented no-op + receipt note.
TRANSPORT="${TRANSPORT:-none}"
```

Headless usage: set `GH_TOKEN` (a PAT or a CI/`GITHUB_TOKEN`) in the
environment; `gh` is then fully non-interactive — no browser, no prompt. This is
the Ralph/cron/CI path. `gh auth status --json` (gh ≥ 2.x) can confirm the active
account programmatically if a richer probe is wanted, but the exit code is the
load-bearing signal.

## No-op rung (terminal) — never crash

When `TRANSPORT=none`, the configured bridge cannot reach GitHub this run. Every
one of the six interface methods becomes a documented no-op (same fail-soft
contract as the Linear terminal rung and fn-51's manual rung):

- `fetchIssue` / `listComments` / `readStatus` / `listIssueRelations` → return
 nothing actionable ("no remote view available this run"); the spec's flow-side
 state is left untouched and the merge base is NOT advanced.
- `writeIssue` / `postComment` / `setStatus` / `setIssueRelation` → perform no
 remote write.
- The run emits `sync receipt … --status noop --transport none ${EVENT:+--event "$EVENT"}
 --note "no GitHub transport reachable (gh not installed or not authenticated; set GH_TOKEN)"`.
- `lastSyncedAt` is never advanced on a no-op (no real reconciliation happened).

## `gh` connection facts (pin these — they have sharp edges)

- **Auth (headless):** `GH_TOKEN` (preferred for non-interactive) or
 `GITHUB_TOKEN` in CI. `gh auth status` exits 0 iff a token resolves; it does
 **not** need `--json` for the probe. Never prompt — a missing token ⇒ the no-op
 rung, not an interactive login.
- **Repo target:** `gh` infers the repo from the cwd's git remote. For an
 out-of-tree repo pass `-R <owner>/<repo>` on every command (the bridge config's
 `tracker.perTracker.repo` supplies it). Pin the repo explicitly in CI where cwd
 may differ.
- **Bodies via `--body-file -`, NEVER raw `--body`.** Markdown bodies contain
 backticks, `$`, newlines, and quotes that break shell quoting on `--body`. Write
 the body to a temp file (or pipe stdin) and use `--body-file -`. This is the
 GitHub analog of "pass bodies as GraphQL variables" on the Linear rung — same
 failure mode (escaping mangles the round-trip), same fix.
- **id vs number:**
 - **Durable dedupe key = the GraphQL node id** (`id`, e.g. `I_kwDO…`) from
 `--json id`. Store it via `sync set-tracker-id` — never the `#123` number.
 - `#123` (`number`) is the display key (the normalized `identifier`); surface it
 to humans. GitHub does not reuse issue numbers within a repo, but the node id
 is still the canonical, transfer-stable key — transferring an issue to another
 repo changes its `number`, not its node id. Keep the node id authoritative,
 consistent with the Linear UUID rule.
 - `gh issue` subcommands accept the **number** (or a URL) as the positional arg;
 the node id is for storage/dedup, not for `gh` command input.
- **State is two-valued + a reason** (the fidelity gap — see below):
 `--json state` → `OPEN` | `CLOSED`; `--json stateReason` →
 `COMPLETED` | `NOT_PLANNED` | `REOPENED` | `null`.
- **Rate limit is request-count (5,000/hr authenticated REST; GraphQL has a
 separate point budget).** Unlike Linear (complexity-based HTTP 400 `RATELIMITED`),
 GitHub returns **HTTP 403 / 429 with `Retry-After` or
 `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0` + `X-RateLimit-Reset`**. `gh` surfaces this as a
 non-zero exit with the message in stderr. **Back off and retry** (exponential,
 honor `Retry-After`/`X-RateLimit-Reset`) rather than failing the run — same
 non-destructive contract as the Linear rung, different signal.

## State fidelity — reduced vs Linear (the key GitHub difference)

Linear has a rich, team-defined workflow-state taxonomy (5 `state.type`s + named
states). GitHub native state is only **`OPEN`/`CLOSED` + a `stateReason`**. The
flow/Linear normalized vocabulary (`backlog` · `planned` · `in-progress` ·
`in-review` · `done` · `verified` · `deferred` · `wontfix`) is **richer than
GitHub can natively represent**. So the GitHub adapter:

1. **Maps the normalized status DOWN to GitHub's two-value native state + reason**
 (what `setStatus` writes), and
2. **Carries the fine-grained status as a label** (`status:in-progress`,
 `status:in-review`, …) so the full flow status survives a round-trip and
 `readStatus` can recover it.

### Read (`readStatus` / `fetchIssue` → normalized `status`)

Prefer the `status:` label when present (it carries full fidelity); fall back to
native `state` + `stateReason` when no `status:` label exists (e.g. an issue
edited directly on GitHub by a human who didn't touch the label):

| GitHub native (`state` / `stateReason`) | `status:` label present? | normalized | who-wins ([status-sync.md](status-sync.md)) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPEN` | `status:<x>` | use the label's `<x>` (`in-progress` / `in-review` / `planned` / `backlog`) | per fn-52.5 |
| `OPEN` | none | `in-progress` (best-effort default for an open issue) | flow wins |
| `CLOSED` / `COMPLETED` | (label ignored — native is authoritative for closed) | `done` | tracker wins |
| `CLOSED` / `NOT_PLANNED` | — | `wontfix` (or `deferred` via config) — **surface, never auto-apply** | surface to user |
| `CLOSED` / `null` (legacy close) | — | `done` (treat a reasonless close as completed) | tracker wins |

`status.raw` = the literal GitHub signal (e.g. `"CLOSED/NOT_PLANNED"` or the
`status:` label text) for the sync log; `status.normalized` = the table result.

### Write (`setStatus` — map normalized DOWN)

| normalized | GitHub native action | `status:` label |
|---|---|---|
| `backlog` / `planned` / `in-progress` / `in-review` | ensure **OPEN** (`gh issue reopen` if closed) | set `status:<normalized>` (remove any other `status:*`) |
| `done` / `verified` | `gh issue close --reason completed` | set `status:<normalized>` (so `verified` vs `done` is recoverable) |
| `deferred` / `wontfix` | **do NOT auto-apply** — these are R7 surface-only | — |

**`deferred` / `wontfix` are surfaced, never auto-applied** (R7 semantics, same as
Linear's `canceled`-type states): the adapter reports the desired transition to
the user (or queues it in Ralph) rather than closing the issue as `not planned`
unilaterally. A human confirms a `wontfix`/`deferred` close. The mapping ABOVE
that produces them is for the *read* direction (interpreting a human's
GitHub-side close) — only the open/closed-completed transitions are auto-written.

**Idempotent `status:` labels.** Treat `status:*` as a single-valued label
namespace: when setting one, remove the others (`gh issue edit … --add-label
status:in-review --remove-label status:in-progress`). Create the label set once at
config time (`gh label create status:in-progress …` — optional; GitHub auto-allows
unknown labels on `--add-label` only if they already exist, so pre-create them or
tolerate the "label not found" by creating on demand).

### Readiness label (`tracker.readyState` — fn-58 R3/R4)

GitHub has no workflow states, so the readiness signal resolves to a **label**:
`tracker.readyState` holds a label name (the ceremony pre-creates it and writes
the config **only once the label is confirmed to exist** — steps.md Phase 1
step 5 tolerates the already-exists 422 as idempotent but surfaces any other
`gh label create` failure instead of writing the config, so the ceremony never
manufactures the stale-config warn/noop below). Read-side semantics
([status-sync.md](status-sync.md) § Readiness projection owns the procedure):

- **Label present on the issue ⇒ local `ready=true`; label ABSENT ⇒
 `ready=false`** — absence is a *normal* state (un-labeling IS how a GitHub user
 un-readies a spec), never an error and never a warn/noop.
- Only an **unresolvable config** warns: the configured label missing from the
 *repo's* label namespace (`gh label list -R "$REPO" --search "$READY_LABEL"
 --json name` — substring search, compare names case-insensitively for the exact
 match) ⇒ warn `noop` receipt, flag untouched, sync continues.
- **One-way pull:** the adapter never adds/removes the readiness label from the
 flow side — readiness is projected tracker → local only, and it is independent
 of the single-valued `status:*` namespace above (a `ready` label coexists with
 any `status:<x>` label).

## Normalized mapping — the firewall

The `gh` JSON wire shape maps **to/from** the normalized structs in
[adapter-interface.md](adapter-interface.md) (`issue` / `comment` /
`status {raw, normalized}`) **at the adapter boundary**. Reconcile (fn-52.4/.5)
only ever sees the normalized form — a transport bug stays in this file; a merge
bug stays in reconcile.

| normalized `issue` field | GitHub source (`gh issue view --json …`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `id` (node id `I_kwDO…`) | **durable dedupe key** — stored via `sync set-tracker-id`. Never the `number`. |
| `identifier` | `"#" + number` (e.g. `#123`) | display only; surfaced in listings. |
| `title` | `title` | |
| `body` | `body` | free-form markdown. |
| `status.raw` | `state` + `stateReason` (+ `status:` label) | the literal GitHub signal. |
| `status.normalized` | the read-mapping table above | reduced-fidelity recovery via `status:` label. |
| `priority` | (none native) — a `priority:*` label if the repo uses one | folded, never auto-changed (R7). |
| `labels` | `labels[].name` | includes the `flow:<id>` back-reference label AND the `status:*` label. |
| `url` | `url` | |
| `updatedAt` | `updatedAt` | drives staleness + echo-suppression. |

`tracker`/`type` on the struct are set to `"github"` / `"issue"`.

## The six interface methods over `gh`

Mapping wire ↔ normalized happens here, at the adapter boundary. Reconcile never
sees a `gh` JSON shape. (`-R <repo>` is the configured `tracker.perTracker.repo`;
omit it when running inside the target repo's checkout.)

### `fetchIssue(trackerId)` → normalized `issue` | not-found

```bash
gh issue view "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" \
 --json id,number,title,body,state,stateReason,labels,url,updatedAt,author
```
- Map per the table above. `state`/`stateReason`/`status:` label → `status`.
- **not-found:** a deleted/transferred/404 issue makes `gh issue view` **exit
 non-zero** with `Could not resolve to an Issue` (or `404`) on stderr ⇒ return
 `not-found` — **never raise out of the adapter**. The skeleton then emits an
 `errored` receipt + prompts/queues unlink (see the error contract below).

### `writeIssue(issue)` → `{id, identifier, url}` (upsert)

```bash
# CREATE (no issue.id) — body via --body-file - to dodge shell quoting.
# `gh issue create` has NO --json output; it prints the new issue's URL on stdout.
URL=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | gh issue create -R "$REPO" \
 --title "$TITLE" --body-file - \
 --label "flow:$FLOW_ID" --label "status:$NORMALIZED_STATUS")
NUMBER=$(printf '%s' "$URL" | sed -E 's@.*/issues/([0-9]+).*@\1@')
# Re-view to capture the durable node id (the create output has no id):
gh issue view "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" --json id,number,url

# UPDATE (issue.id present) — number is the positional arg.
# PRESERVE the flow-owned <!-- flow:deps -->…<!-- /flow:deps --> region: $BODY is the
# rendered spec body (renderFlowToTracker), which never contains the dep block — a raw
# full-body replace would WIPE it, and the next projectDepRelations would misread the
# ledgered edge as remotely-removed → false collision (self-deletes projected deps).
# Read the current body, carry its fenced block forward into the rendered body, THEN edit:
CURRENT=$(gh issue view "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" --json body -q .body)
DEPS_BLOCK=$(printf '%s' "$CURRENT" | sed -n '/<!-- flow:deps -->/,/<!-- \/flow:deps -->/p')
BODY_WITH_DEPS="$BODY"
[ -n "$DEPS_BLOCK" ] && BODY_WITH_DEPS=$(printf '%s\n\n%s' "$BODY" "$DEPS_BLOCK")
printf '%s' "$BODY_WITH_DEPS" | gh issue edit "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" \
 --title "$TITLE" --body-file -
```
- **Preserve the `<!-- flow:deps -->` fenced region on every UPDATE.** This is the
 WRITE half of the `trackerBodyForMerge` ownership model ([body-merge.md](body-merge.md)
 § Step 0.5): the merge strips the block at the hash boundary; the write must RETAIN
 it. Carry the existing block forward verbatim (idempotent — a later `setIssueRelation`
 edits *only inside* the markers). `renderFlowToTracker` never emits the block, so a
 naive `--body-file -` of `$BODY` alone self-deletes a normal push's projected deps and
 contradicts body-merge.md's "render never overwrites it" invariant. Linear native
 relations live off-body and need no carry-forward — this is GitHub-fallback-specific.
- **Upsert by presence of `issue.id`** (interface rule): no id ⇒ create; id ⇒ edit.
- `gh issue create` prints only the URL (no `--json`), so after a **create**
 derive the `number` from the URL and re-view once
 (`gh issue view --json id,number,url`) to capture the **node id**; return
 `{ id (node id), identifier ("#"+number), url }`.
- Write the flow back-reference on create/first-link: a `flow:<id>` label (and the
 initial `status:<normalized>` label) so the issue points back at the spec.
- `gh issue create` does **not** support label-create-on-the-fly — pre-create the
 `flow:*` / `status:*` labels at config time, or `gh label create` on demand.

### `setStatus(trackerId, status)` → ok | errored

Apply the write-mapping table above:

```bash
case "$NORMALIZED" in
 done|verified)
 gh issue edit "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" \
 --add-label "status:$NORMALIZED" $(remove_other_status_labels)
 gh issue close "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" --reason completed ;;
 backlog|planned|in-progress|in-review)
 gh issue reopen "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" 2>/dev/null # no-op if already open
 gh issue edit "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" \
 --add-label "status:$NORMALIZED" $(remove_other_status_labels) ;;
 deferred|wontfix)
 : ;; # R7: surface to the user / queue — NEVER auto-close as "not planned"
esac
```
- A `gh` non-zero exit (bad number, perms, label-not-found) ⇒ return `errored`
 (don't crash). The skeleton writes an `errored` receipt and does not advance
 state.
- `remove_other_status_labels` ⇒ `--remove-label` for each `status:*` not being
 set (keeps the namespace single-valued).

### `listComments(trackerId)` → normalized `comment[]`

```bash
gh issue view "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" \
 --json comments -q '.comments[] | {id, author: .author.login, body, createdAt, url}'
```
- **GitHub comment ids are stable** (the node id `IC_kwDO…` on each comment) —
 same dedup property the Linear comments rely on; safe as the dedup key.
- Map each: `author.login`→`author`; `body`, `createdAt`; **detect the
 `flow-evt:<event>` marker** in `body` → set `marker` (flow's own echo, skipped
 on pull); genuine tracker-side comments get `marker:null` and pull into the spec
 sync log. Same dedup-marker scheme as fn-52.5 ([comments-sync.md](comments-sync.md)).
- `gh issue view --json comments` returns all comments inline (no manual paging
 needed for typical issues); for very large threads page via
 `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments --paginate`.

### `postComment(trackerId, body)` → normalized `comment`

```bash
printf '%s' "$BODY_WITH_MARKER" | gh issue comment "$NUMBER" -R "$REPO" --body-file -
```
- `$BODY_WITH_MARKER` carries the `flow-evt:<event>` marker line (echo suppression
 + dedup, per [comments-sync.md](comments-sync.md)).
- `gh issue comment` prints the new comment's URL; re-`listComments` (or
 `gh api …/comments` with the URL) to recover the node id for the returned
 normalized `comment`.
- **`--body-file -`**, never raw `--body` (markdown quoting).

### `readStatus(trackerId)` → normalized `status`

Derived from the `fetchIssue` `state` + `stateReason` + `status:` label — no
separate call (same as Linear deriving status from `state{name type}`).

## Relation transport (dependency projection, fn-64.4)

The `listIssueRelations` / `setIssueRelation` pair ([adapter-interface.md](adapter-interface.md)
§ Relation transport) projects a Flow `depends_on_epics` edge as a **blocked-by**
relation. GitHub has **two** fidelities, selected by a feature-detect probe — the
same reduced-fidelity posture this adapter already takes for status:

| Path | Transport | Use when | Fidelity |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Native** | REST issue dependencies via `gh api` (`…/dependencies/blocked_by`) | the GET probe below exits 0 (endpoint present, not 404/410) | first-class, board-visible "Blocked by" |
| **Fallback** | provenance-fenced `<!-- flow:deps -->` body block of `#N` refs | the probe 404s/410s (account/repo lacks native deps) OR `gh` unreachable | body-rendered list, reduced |
| **no-op** | none + `noop` receipt | `TRANSPORT=none` (gh not installed / unauthed) | nothing written |

The fenced fallback is the GitHub analog of `setStatus`'s `status:` label: when the
native model is missing, the relation survives as a documented body artifact rather
than failing the run. The **direction convention is anchored once** in
adapter-interface.md — *the current issue (A) is blocked by the dependency issue (B)*;
both GitHub paths point A's "blocked by" at B, never inverted.

### Native facts (pin these — verified against the official REST docs + a live `gh api` probe, 2026-06-17)

- **GA Aug 2025**; REST under `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Endpoints:
 - `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/dependencies/blocked_by` → JSON **array of Issue
 objects** (each has `id` (DB id), `number`, `state`, …); `[]` when none.
 - `POST /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/dependencies/blocked_by` with body
 `{"issue_id": <numeric DB id of the BLOCKER>}`.
 - `DELETE /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/dependencies/blocked_by/{issue_id}` — **OPTIONAL
 / future**, not implemented here (default safe no-delete; never removes a remote
 relation — R6).
- **`issue_id` is the numeric DB id, NOT `#N`.** The POST body and the GET response
 both speak DB ids. `gh issue` positional args and the `#N` display key are a
 *different* namespace — resolve `#N` → DB id with one extra call
 (`gh api repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n} --jq .id`) before POSTing. The endpoint path
 itself takes the **issue number** `{n}` (the blocked issue A); only the body
 `issue_id` is the DB id (the blocker B). Mixing the two is the sharp edge.
- **Only `blocked_by` is writable; max 50 dependencies per type.** Flow projects
 exactly the blocked-by edge, so this single writable direction is sufficient. Stop
 appending at 50 and surface a warning rather than erroring the run.

### Feature-detect (probe, don't assume) — native vs fallback

```bash
# Resolve the repo's owner/repo once (or use the configured tracker.perTracker.repo).
# Probe the GET endpoint on the issue being projected (A = $NUMBER):
PROBE=$(gh api -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" \
 "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUMBER/dependencies/blocked_by" 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
 REL_PATH=native # endpoint present (a 200 + JSON array, even when empty `[]`)
else
 REL_PATH=fallback # 404/410 (or any non-zero) → account/repo lacks native deps
fi
# When TRANSPORT=none (gh not installed/unauthed) the probe never runs → no-op rung.
```

A `[]` array is the **available-but-empty** signal (seen live on this repo), NOT a
"not found" — only a non-zero exit (404/410) selects the fallback. The probe is per
the issue being projected; cache the verdict for the run.

### `listIssueRelations(issue)` → normalized `relation[]`

**Native:**
```bash
gh api -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" \
 "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUMBER/dependencies/blocked_by" \
 --jq '.[] | {number, id}'
```
Each blocker issue → one `relation`: `{ from: "#"+A.number (blocked), to: "#"+blocker.number (blocking), type: "blocks", source: "unknown" }`. Native deps store no authorship, so `source` is `unknown` and the flow-side `depRelations` ledger (fn-64.1) is the provenance authority (R6/R7) — same as Linear's native relations.

**Fallback:** parse the `#N` lines **inside** the `<!-- flow:deps -->` … `<!-- /flow:deps -->` markers of the issue body (`gh issue view "$NUMBER" --json body -q .body`). Each `#N` inside the markers → `{ from: "#"+A.number, to: "#N", type: "blocks", source: "flow" }` (inside the fence ⇒ provably ours). `#N` references **outside** the markers are NOT relations — never returned (they could be any human cross-reference).

### `setIssueRelation(issue=A, blockedBy=B)` → ok | errored | noop

**Read-before-write on both paths (mandatory, R3):** `listIssueRelations(A)` first; skip the write when A-is-blocked-by-B already exists. Neither path no-ops a duplicate for free.

**Native:**
```bash
# 1. Resolve B's #N → numeric DB id (the POST body speaks DB ids, not #N):
BLOCKER_ID=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$B_NUMBER" --jq '.id')
# 2. POST the blocked_by edge on A (the endpoint path takes A's NUMBER).
# issue_id MUST be a JSON NUMBER, not a string — use -F (--field, type-aware:
# bare integers stay numeric), NEVER -f (--raw-field, always a string):
gh api --method POST -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" \
 "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$A_NUMBER/dependencies/blocked_by" \
 -F "issue_id=$BLOCKER_ID"
```
- **`-F`, not `-f`, for `issue_id`.** GitHub rejects a string id; `gh api -f` would
 send `"issue_id":"123"` (string) and 422. `-F`/`--field` types a bare integer as
 a JSON number. (Equivalent: pipe `jq -n --argjson issue_id "$BLOCKER_ID" '{issue_id:$issue_id}'` to `--input -`.)
- Stop at the **50/type cap**: count the existing `blocked_by` set first; at 50, skip + warn (never error the whole run).
- A `gh` non-zero exit (bad id, perms, 422 already-exists) ⇒ return `errored` (don't crash); a 422 "already exists" is treated as an idempotent success (the read-before-write should have caught it, but tolerate the race).

**Fallback (fenced body block):** rewrite **only inside** the `<!-- flow:deps -->` markers, idempotently (R3):
```markdown
<!-- flow:deps -->
**Blocked by:** #12, #15, #23
<!-- /flow:deps -->
```
- If the markers are absent, append a fresh empty block to the body (the only edit outside the markers — establishing the fence — never touches existing body text).
- Inside the markers: add `#B_NUMBER` only when not already present (dedup on the `#N` token, not a substring). No marker ⇒ create; existing entry ⇒ no-op. A re-run appends nothing.
- Write the merged body back via `gh issue edit "$A_NUMBER" --body-file -` (NEVER raw `--body` — the body-quoting rule above). Use the **opaque `#N` token** as the stored ref (consistent with the trackers-auto-linkify-issue-key pattern — GitHub's `#N` linkify is milder than Linear's key linkify, but keep the marker-content discipline uniform across adapters).
- The marker is the **provenance boundary**: only `#N` inside it are flow's (`source: "flow"`). The body-merge layer excludes the fenced region from divergence detection (fn-64.5 owns the exclusion) so reconcile never folds flow's own block back into the spec.

**Never-delete-non-ours (R6):** `setIssueRelation` only ever ADDS the blocked-by edge — on both paths. Native: provenance is the ledger; a native dep not in the ledger is not ours, left alone. Fallback: only lines inside the fence are ours; a `#N` a human wrote elsewhere in the body is never touched.

**Completed-blocker (R5).** A dependency whose issue is closed/done stays a visible blocked-by relation on both paths — the native dep is left in place (a closed blocker still renders on the board) and the fenced `#N` entry is not stripped. The adapter never decides this; the completed-blocker call is the skill's (fn-64.5), keyed off the **local** dep-spec status (`dep_status` from `flowctl sync list-dep-relations`), and it must not feed back into `ready=true` gating — readiness already treats done deps as satisfied. The relation is historical/audit, not a re-gate.

**`#N` identifier parsing.** The fallback writer/reader accepts the `#N`, `owner/repo#N`, and bare `N` forms when matching an existing entry (memory: set-tracker-id-rejected-github-n — the same widening fn-64.1 applied to the identifier validator); it always *writes* the canonical `#N` form. Cross-repo `owner/repo#N` refs are tolerated on read but native deps are single-repo (`tracker.perTracker.repo`), so projection stays in-repo.

## `makePr` — link the PR to the issue (native GitHub, no "Diffs")

When the tracker is **GitHub**, the spec maps to a GitHub *issue* and the PR lives
in the same repo, so linkage is **native GitHub cross-referencing** — no Linear
attachment, no Linear Diffs (GitHub has its own PR review UI). make-pr §4.6a's
Linear branch is GitHub-typed-skipped; instead the GitHub adapter ensures the PR
body carries a **non-closing** reference to the issue — `Refs #<number>` (NOT
`Fixes #<number>`, which would auto-close the issue on merge and bypass
spec-completion-review; flow-next owns the lifecycle, R7/R10). GitHub then renders
the PR↔issue cross-link automatically. Gate is the same as Linear: bridge **active
AND tracker.type == github** — no separate `makePr` opt-in. There is no rich-attach
step (the cross-reference IS the link).

## Capability parity (GitHub ↔ Linear) — the R13 guarantee

Reconcile is genuinely transport-blind only if the GitHub adapter produces the
**same normalized structs** the Linear adapter does, for every interface method.
Verify per method:

| Interface method | GitHub (`gh`) | Linear ([linear-ladder.md](linear-ladder.md)) | Parity target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fetchIssue` | `gh issue view --json …` | `get_issue` / `issue(id)` | same `issue` struct (title/body/status/priority/labels/url/updatedAt) |
| `writeIssue` (upsert) | `gh issue create` / `gh issue edit` | `save_issue` / `issueCreate`/`issueUpdate` | same `{id, identifier, url}` |
| `listComments` | `gh issue view --json comments` | `list_comments` / `comments(first:N)` | same `comment[]` (author/body/createdAt/marker) |
| `postComment` | `gh issue comment --body-file -` | `save_comment` / `commentCreate` | same `comment` |
| `readStatus` | from `state`+`stateReason`+`status:` label | from `state{name type}` | same `status{raw,normalized}` |
| `setStatus` | `gh issue close/reopen` + `status:` label | `save_issue(state)` / `issueUpdate(stateId)` | ok / `errored` |
| `listIssueRelations` | native `…/dependencies/blocked_by` (reduced → fenced `#N` block) | `issue{ relations + inverseRelations }` | same blocked-by `relation[]` (`{from,to,type:"blocks",source}`) |
| `setIssueRelation` | native POST `blocked_by` (reduced → fenced-block append) | `issueRelationCreate(type:blocks)` | ok / `errored` / `noop`; read-before-write on both |
| status map | open/closed+reason+`status:` label (reduced — recovered via label) | team `workflowStates` / `list_issue_statuses` | same **normalized** vocabulary out |

The fidelity gap (GitHub's two-value native state) is bridged by the `status:`
label so the **normalized output is identical** — that is what makes reconcile
transport-blind despite GitHub's poorer native model. If a `status:` label is
absent (human-edited issue), the read-mapping table degrades gracefully to a
best-effort normalized value; that is a documented reduced-fidelity case, not a
parity break (the struct shape is still identical).

The same holds for relations: native `blocked_by` deps and the fenced `#N` block
both produce the **identical** normalized `relation[]` (`{from,to,type:"blocks",source}`),
so the skill (fn-64.5) sees one transport-blind hook regardless of which GitHub
path served it — only the `source` field differs (`unknown` on native, deferring
to the ledger; `flow` inside the fenced marker). Native-vs-fallback is a fidelity
selection, not a parity break.

## Transport-blind proof / round-trip spike (acceptance #3 — run FIRST)

The R13 guarantee: **the same reconcile path over `gh` fixtures yields merge
output identical to the Linear path.** Two checks:

### A. Round-trip spike (transport in isolation — no merge)

Push a flow body to a real GitHub issue, then pull it back — format translation
only. Surfaces transport bugs (auth, `--body-file` escaping, number-vs-node-id,
markdown round-trip) BEFORE relying on reconcile.

> **Live-verification status (this environment).** A live GitHub round-trip needs
> a real `GH_TOKEN` against a real repo with issue write access — unavailable in
> the build environment, so the **live execution is deferred to the post-PR
> smoke-testing phase** the maintainer drives. The spike below is a complete,
> runnable procedure with an explicit success/fail oracle; the `gh` flags + JSON
> fields it depends on are verified and pinned above (gh ≥ 2.x). Run it once.

Fixture (the same canonical flow body the Linear spike uses — headings, a
checklist, a fenced block, a link — the structures most likely to be mangled):

~~~markdown
## Goal
Round-trip fixture for the GitHub transport spike.

## Acceptance
- [ ] item one
- [x] item two (done)

## Notes
A fenced block:

```
exact text — must survive verbatim
```

A [link](https://example.com) and an inline `code` span.
~~~

Steps:

1. **Build the body** — write the fixture to `/tmp/spike-flow-body.md`.
2. **Push (create)** via `writeIssue` (no id ⇒ create), body via `--body-file -`:
 ```bash
 NUM=$(gh issue create -R "$REPO" --title "flow spike" \
 --body-file /tmp/spike-flow-body.md \
 | sed -E 's@.*/issues/([0-9]+).*@\1@')
 ```
3. **Pull back** via `fetchIssue(number)`:
 ```bash
 gh issue view "$NUM" -R "$REPO" --json body -q .body > /tmp/spike-pulled-body.md
 ```
4. **Oracle (success/fail):**
 ```bash
 if diff -u /tmp/spike-flow-body.md /tmp/spike-pulled-body.md; then
 echo "SPIKE PASS — round-trip preserved the body"
 else
 echo "SPIKE FAIL — gh transport mangled the body; see diff above"
 fi
 ```
 A non-empty diff is a transport bug to fix here BEFORE relying on reconcile —
 e.g. GitHub normalizing trailing whitespace or line endings. (If GitHub
 canonicalizes markdown in a stable, loss-less way, record that exact canonical
 form as the fixture's expected output so .4 reconciles against *that*.)
5. **Cleanup:** `gh issue close "$NUM" -R "$REPO" --reason "not planned"` (or
 delete via `gh issue delete "$NUM" -R "$REPO" --yes` where the token allows).

The spike writes a receipt like any sync run:
`sync receipt <spec> --status noop --transport gh --note "round-trip spike: PASS|FAIL"`
(status `noop` — a transport probe, not a sync of a tracked spec; no `--event`
either — the spike is a manual diagnostic, never a lifecycle touchpoint).

### B. Cross-tracker reconcile parity (the actual R13 check)

Feed the **same normalized fixtures** through reconcile twice — once with the
GitHub adapter's output structs, once with the Linear adapter's — and assert the
merge output is identical:

```bash
# Pseudo-procedure (reconcile is agentic — fn-52.4/.5 — and consumes structs):
# 1. Take a flow body + a base snapshot + a tracker-side edit.
# 2. Produce the normalized `issue`/`comment`/`status` structs TWICE:
# - via the GitHub mapping tables above (open/closed+reason+status: label)
# - via the Linear mapping (state{name type})
# Construct both so they represent the SAME logical state (e.g. GitHub
# OPEN+`status:in-progress` ≡ Linear `started`/`in-progress`).
# 3. Run the UNCHANGED reconcile core (body-merge.md / status-sync.md /
# comments-sync.md) on each struct set against the same base.
# 4. Oracle: the two merge outputs are identical (same merged body, same
# who-wins status, same comment dedup). Any difference is a mapping bug in
# an adapter — NOT a reconcile change. Reconcile is never edited to make a
# transport pass.
```

This is the load-bearing R13 assertion: identical reconcile output across Linear
and GitHub fixtures, with the reconcile core touched in neither task.

## Error contract (acceptance #4) — never crash, never corrupt state

The adapter honors the [adapter-interface.md](adapter-interface.md) contract rules.
The failure modes that MUST be non-destructive:

- **Missing / deleted / transferred / 404 linked issue** — `gh issue view` exits
 non-zero (`Could not resolve to an Issue`, `404`). `fetchIssue` returns
 `not-found` (NEVER raises). The skeleton then:
 - emits `sync receipt … --status errored --transport gh ${EVENT:+--event "$EVENT"}`,
 - does **NOT** crash, does **NOT** clear state, does **NOT** advance
 `lastSyncedAt` (a failed fetch must never corrupt the merge base),
 - prompts the user to unlink (interactive) or queues an unlink decision
 (`sync defer`, Ralph) — never a silent `sync clear`.
- **Unauthenticated mid-run** (`GH_TOKEN` expired/revoked) — `gh` exits with an
 auth error. Treat as the **no-op rung** for that operation: `noop` receipt
 + note, no state write — same as never having had a transport.
- **Rate limit** — GitHub returns **HTTP 403/429 with `Retry-After` /
 `X-RateLimit-Reset`** (NOT Linear's complexity 400). `gh` surfaces a non-zero
 exit + stderr message. **Back off and retry** (exponential, honor the reset
 hint) rather than failing the run.
- **Batch sync is item-level** — one spec's `errored`/rate-limit does not abort
 the batch: that spec gets its own `errored` receipt + no state write, and the
 run continues to the next spec.
- **Echo suppression** — after a push, the resulting tracker-side body hash is
 recorded (rides on the merge-base snapshot, fn-52.4); the next pull's matching
 hash ⇒ flow's own echo ⇒ `noop`, never a phantom conflict. `updatedAt` from the
 `gh` JSON helps distinguish a real GitHub-side edit from an echo. Comment echo
 uses the `flow-evt:<event>` marker (above), same as Linear.

## Boundaries

- **This is the transport, not the merge.** The adapter maps `gh` JSON ↔
 normalized and routes the single rung / no-op. The 3-way body merge
 ([body-merge.md](body-merge.md), fn-52.4), the status who-wins
 ([status-sync.md](status-sync.md), fn-52.5), and the comments/evidence append +
 dedup ([comments-sync.md](comments-sync.md), fn-52.5) consume the normalized
 structs and live in those tasks — **reused unchanged** here.
- **Reduced fidelity is by design.** GitHub's two-value native state cannot match
 Linear's workflow taxonomy; the `status:` label bridges it so the *normalized*
 output is identical. Document the gap (above); do not invent a richer GitHub
 state model.
- **No new hard dependency.** `gh` is not required; the terminal rung is a
 documented no-op. The zero-dep base install is untouched (spec Boundaries /
 STRATEGY opt-in carve-out).
- **One GitHub repo per linked spec** (`tracker.perTracker.repo`) — the bridge
 config resolves a single `owner/repo` per repo, mirroring the one-team Linear
 constraint.
