## What Is This?

Flow-Next is an AI agent orchestration plugin. **Sixteen agent-native skills** for the full lifecycle: idea → spec → tasks → review → ship → maintain. Bundled task tracking, dependency graphs, re-anchoring, multi-model reviews, decay-aware project memory, GitHub PR resolution, agent-readiness audits. Everything lives in your repo — no external services, no global config. Uninstall: delete `.flow/`.

First-class on **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex** (CLI + Desktop), and **Factory Droid**. Also runs on **OpenCode** via the [community port](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next-opencode).

> 🆕 **v0.40.0 — Project strategy anchor.** New `/flow-next:strategy` skill writes/maintains a repo-root `STRATEGY.md` (peer of `GLOSSARY.md` / `README.md`, never under `.flow/` — survives `rm -rf .flow/`). Section structure derived from Richard Rumelt's strategy kernel (diagnosis / guiding policy / coherent action): 5 required sections (`Target problem` / `Our approach` / `Who it's for` / `Key metrics` / `Tracks`) + 2 optional (`Milestones` / `Not working on`). `flowctl strategy status / read / list` plumbing; the skill IS the editor (no `add/edit` subcommands — strategy is too prose-heavy for atomic CLI). Single-root resolution at repo root only (NOT nearest-ancestor like glossary — strategy is repo-wide by Rumelt's definition). Doc-aware autodetect extended with a third condition (`strategy.sections_filled >= 1`); 5-row flag matrix where `--docs` / `--no-docs` cascade to all three categories and explicit `--strategy` / `--no-strategy` always wins over the cascade. Downstream `/flow-next:prospect` / `:plan` / `:interview` / `:capture` / `:sync` all consume `STRATEGY.md` read-only. Tier 1 fluff guard (R19) added in CI canonical + Codex mirror. Ralph-blocked. [Full changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**Why a script for Codex?** Codex's plugin protocol currently only registers `skills` from `plugin.json` — not custom `.toml` agents or hooks. The `/plugins` install gives you slash commands, but no subagent isolation (worker model tier, `disallowed_tools`) and no Ralph hooks. `install-codex.sh` merges all 21 agents + hooks directly into `~/.codex/config.toml` so you get the full multi-agent + Ralph experience. We'll switch to `/plugins` once Codex's manifest supports `agents` and `hooks` fields.

**Update Codex:** `cd flow-next && git pull && ./scripts/install-codex.sh flow-next`. The script is idempotent — safe to re-run on every update.

## The Workflow

    Idea([💡 Idea]) --> P[/flow-next:prospect/]
    Idea --> C[/flow-next:capture/]
    P --> C

    A -.-> M[(.flow/memory/)]
```

Idea → spec → tasks → ship. Branch in, branch out — pick the entry point that matches your context.

## Why It Works

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Context drift | **Re-anchoring** before every task — re-reads specs + git state |
| Context window limits | **Fresh context per task** — worker subagent starts clean |
| Single-model blind spots | **Cross-model reviews** — RepoPrompt, Codex, or Copilot as second opinion |
| Forgotten requirements | **Dependency graphs** — tasks declare blockers, run in order |
| "It worked on my machine" | **Evidence recording** — commits, tests, PRs tracked per task |
| Infinite retry loops | **Auto-block stuck tasks** — fails after N attempts, moves on |
| Duplicate implementations | **Pre-implementation search** — worker checks for similar code before writing new |
| Hallucinated specs from "I think we discussed…" | **Source-tagged capture** — every acceptance criterion marked `[user]` / `[paraphrase]` / `[inferred]`, mandatory read-back loop |
| Stale project memory polluting future work | **`/flow-next:audit` + categorized memory schema** — agent reviews each entry, flags stale (never deletes) |
| GitHub PR review threads piling up | **`/flow-next:resolve-pr`** — fetch → triage → dispatch resolver agents → reply → resolve via GraphQL |

## Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/flow-next:prospect` | Generate ranked candidate ideas grounded in the repo, upstream of `capture`/`interview`/`plan` |
| `/flow-next:capture` | Synthesize conversation context into an epic spec (source-tagged, mandatory read-back) |
| `/flow-next:interview` | Deep spec refinement with lead-with-recommendation + confidence tiers + codebase-first investigation |
| `/flow-next:plan` | Research codebase, create epic + dependency-ordered tasks |
| `/flow-next:work` | Execute tasks with re-anchoring + worker subagents + review gates |
| `/flow-next:impl-review` | Cross-model implementation review (RepoPrompt, Codex, or Copilot) |
| `/flow-next:plan-review` | Cross-model plan review |
| `/flow-next:epic-review` | Epic-completion review gate — verify combined implementation matches spec |
| `/flow-next:resolve-pr` | Resolve GitHub PR review threads (fetch → triage → fix → reply → resolve via GraphQL) |
| `/flow-next:audit` | Agent-native review of `.flow/memory/` entries against current code (Keep / Update / Consolidate / Replace / Delete) |
| `/flow-next:memory-migrate` | Lift legacy flat memory files into the categorized schema; agent classifies each entry |
| `/flow-next:prime` | 8-pillar agent-readiness assessment with parallel scouts; remediation via consent prompts |
| `/flow-next:ralph-init` | Scaffold autonomous loop (`scripts/ralph/`) |

## Ralph (Autonomous Mode)

Run overnight. Fresh context per iteration + multi-model review gates + auto-block stuck tasks.

```bash
/flow-next:ralph-init           # One-time setup
scripts/ralph/ralph.sh          # Run from terminal
```
