## The Problem

Process failures, not model failures:

- Starting to code before understanding the codebase
- Reinventing patterns already there
- Forgetting the plan mid-implementation
- Skipping edge cases obvious in hindsight

This marketplace ships plugins that fix these problems.

---

## Flow-Next

**Plan first, work second. Zero external dependencies.**

```bash
# Install
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace
/plugin install flow-next

# Setup (configures review backend + CLI tools)
/flow-next:setup

# Use
/flow-next:plan Add a contact form with validation
/flow-next:work fn-1
```

### Why It Works

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Context drift | **Re-anchoring** before EVERY task — re-reads specs + git state from `.flow/` |
| 200K token limits | **Fresh context per task** — worker subagent starts clean each task |
| Single-model blind spots | **Cross-model reviews** — RepoPrompt or Codex as second opinion |
| Forgotten requirements | **Dependency graphs** — tasks declare blockers, nothing runs out of order |
| "It worked on my machine" | **Evidence recording** — commits, test output, PRs tracked per task |
| Infinite retry loops | **Auto-block stuck tasks** — fails after N attempts, moves on |
| Team conflicts | **Multi-user safe** — scan-based IDs, soft claims, no coordination server |

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/flow-next:plan` | Research codebase, create epic + tasks |
| `/flow-next:work` | Execute tasks with re-anchoring |
| `/flow-next:interview` | Deep spec refinement (40+ questions) |
| `/flow-next:plan-review` | Cross-model plan review |
| `/flow-next:impl-review` | Cross-model implementation review |
| `/flow-next:prime` | Assess codebase agent-readiness, propose fixes |
| `/flow-next:ralph-init` | Scaffold autonomous loop |

## Ralph (Autonomous Mode)

Run overnight, walk away. Fresh context per iteration + multi-model review gates.

```bash
/flow-next:ralph-init           # One-time setup
scripts/ralph/ralph.sh          # Run from terminal
```

**How Ralph differs:**

| Aspect | Typical Agents | Ralph |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Context | Accumulates (drift) | Fresh each iteration |
| Review | Self-review only | Cross-model gates |
| Stuck tasks | Infinite retry | Auto-block after N failures |
| Validation | Tests only | Tests + receipts + reviews |

📖 **[Ralph deep dive](plugins/flow-next/docs/ralph.md)** — guard hooks, receipt gating, sentinel controls

🖥️ **[Ralph TUI](flow-next-tui/)** — Terminal UI for monitoring (`bun add -g @gmickel/flow-next-tui`)
