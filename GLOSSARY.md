# Glossary

## Spec

The central artefact of flow-next: a specification at `.flow/specs/<id>.md` (markdown body) plus `.flow/specs/<id>.json` (metadata sidecar, post-1.0). Reviewable on its own; cross-model-reviewed; verifiable against prior handovers; frozen at handover. Replaces the term *epic* from the 0.x line.

## Ready

A human-owned boolean on the spec record (default `false`, toggled via `flowctl spec ready` / `spec unready`) marking a spec complete enough to hand to an agent — the entry gate autonomous loops consume. Orthogonal to `status` (`open|done`): a ready spec stays `open` through planning and work. Human-owned or tracker-projected (`tracker.readyState` pulls the configured tracker state onto the local flag, one-way), never agent-inferred. Opt-in and invisible until adopted: the flag is written lazily, non-adopters see no badge, prompts, or warnings anywhere.

## Task

An execution unit under a spec, sized to fit one `/flow-next:work` iteration (~100k tokens fresh context). Tasks declare dependencies (`requires:`) and may declare which spec acceptance criteria they advance (`satisfies: [R1, R3]`). Implemented by a worker subagent with re-anchored context.

## R-ID

A numbered acceptance criterion in a spec, format `**R1:** ...`, `**R2:** ...`. Renumber-forbidden after the first review cycle: deletions leave gaps, new criteria take the next unused number. R-IDs are the load-bearing identity of a requirement across the spec, the tasks that satisfy it, the commits that reference it, and the PR body coverage table.

## Handover object

A named, reviewable artefact that carries context across a step in the agentic SDLC. flow-next defines six handover states: the spec at business-layer completion (#1) and at full completion (#2) — both the **same** `.flow/specs/<spec-id>.md` file at successive layers, NOT two separate specs — then the implementation plan (#3), the working implementation (#4), the cross-model code review (#5), and the PR-as-cognitive-aid (#6). Each is reviewable on its own, cross-model-verified, and frozen at handover. The chain of handovers replaces the standups / refinement / design-review touchpoints that pre-agentic Agile relied on.

## Re-anchoring

Re-reading the spec, the task, and `git log` since branch base before each task starts. Counters context drift in long-running agent sessions per Anthropic guidance. Worker subagents re-anchor on every iteration; `/flow-next:work` re-anchors every loop turn.

## Cross-model review

A different model reviews the artefact produced by the first model. Applied at every handover. Backends: RepoPrompt (rp), Codex CLI (codex), GitHub Copilot CLI (copilot). The disagreement surface between writing model and reviewing model is where the gaps live.

## Feature map

The `.clawpatch/features/*.json` index produced by `clawpatch map` and consumed by flow-next scouts via `flowctl repo-map`. Semantic feature slices across ~20 languages/frameworks (Zod-validated upstream, `schemaVersion: 1`). Wrapped by the opt-in `/flow-next:map` skill; flow-next core (flowctl) never imports or requires clawpatch — when `.clawpatch/` is absent, scouts gracefully fall back to grep/glob.

## features_anchored

Optional scout output field listing feature slices from the feature map that overlap the current scope. Emitted by `repo-scout` and `context-scout` when `.clawpatch/features/*.json` is present; omitted when absent. Each entry carries a `last_mapped` timestamp so downstream skills can flag staleness (informational signal, not a block).

## Receipt

A JSON artefact that gates Ralph state transitions. `flowctl impl-review` writes a receipt at `.flow/review-receipts/<branch>.json` with verdict (`SHIP` / `NEEDS_WORK` / `MAJOR_RETHINK`), confidence anchors, introduced vs pre-existing finding counts, and the deferred / suppressed counts. Ralph reads receipts to decide loop progression.

## Worker subagent

A subagent dispatched by `/flow-next:work` to implement a single task with fresh context. Re-anchors the spec + task + git state, implements the task, records evidence (commits + tests + done summary), and exits. The fresh context per task is what enables N tasks to run in parallel without context-bleed.

## Carmack-level review

The strict cross-model review tier flow-next runs by default. References John Carmack review standard. Five confidence anchors (0/25/50/75/100) gate findings; `<75` suppressed except P0 @ 50+; introduced vs pre-existing classification means only introduced findings count toward the verdict.

## Triage skip

A deterministic whitelist pre-check that returns `SHIP` without invoking a review backend, for trivial diffs: lockfile-only / docs-only / release-chore / generated-file-only. `flowctl triage-skip` is the helper. On by default in Ralph mode; opt-out via `--no-triage` or `FLOW_RALPH_NO_TRIAGE=1`.

## PR-as-cognitive-aid

A structured PR body synthesizing nine flow-next state streams (spec with R-IDs, per-task done summary + evidence commits, decisions / bug / architecture-patterns memory, glossary changes, strategy alignment, deferred review findings, the diff itself) into a reviewable artefact. Body sections: TL;DR, R-ID coverage table, Critical changes, Decisions, Memory, Glossary/strategy deltas, Open items, Where to look. Produced by `/flow-next:make-pr`.

## Ralph

The flow-next hardened autonomous harness. External shell loop drives fresh Claude / Codex sessions per task with cross-model review gates, hook-enforced guardrails (ralph-guard / DCG), and receipt-based proof-of-work. Consumes **fully planned** specs only — it iterates plan-review -> work -> impl-review -> spec-completion-review until the spec ships or the iteration cap is hit; it never runs the planning fan-out (planning stays with the human or pilot). Differentiator from `ralph-wiggum`-style open-loop autonomous agents. The default autonomy path is the pilot + land pipeline; reach for Ralph when a run outlasts a session or prose guardrails aren't enough — Ralph owns the loop in a shell script, pilot hands the loop to the host's `/loop` / `/goal` primitives.

## Pilot

The single-tick build-loop conductor (`/flow-next:pilot`): one tick advances one ready spec by one pipeline stage (plan / plan-review / work / make-pr) and ends with a terminal `PILOT_VERDICT` line; the host's `/loop` or `/goal` owns iteration. Signals autonomy to sub-skills via the `mode:autonomous` token + `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1` env (distinct from `FLOW_RALPH`; never activates ralph-guard). Selection consumes the fn-58 `ready` gate; two healthy no-advance ticks clear the spec's `ready` flag (don't-thrash).

## Land

The cadence-tick ship loop (`/flow-next:land`): one tick discovers the open PRs the build loop authored (spec `branch_name` match AND the make-pr breadcrumb — both signals required), walks each through the gate tree (CI tri-state over ALL checks, patience window anchored to the last push, resolve-pr convergence, `land.reviewSignal`), and takes at most one action class per PR — CI fix, resolve dispatch, mechanical rebase, or the gated explicit merge (`gh pr merge --squash --match-head-commit`, never `--auto`) plus the post-merge tail (spec close → tracker touchpoint → release-follow). The one confined exception to the no-auto-merge rule; `/loop`-shaped where pilot is `/goal`-shaped. Ends with a terminal `LAND_VERDICT` line.

## Verdict

The structured tick outcome a loop skill prints for transcript-blind drivers, always the last line of a tick. Pilot: `PILOT_VERDICT=<ADVANCED|NO_WORK|BLOCKED|NEEDS_HUMAN> spec=<id> stage=<stage> reason="<one line>"`. Land: `LAND_VERDICT=<MERGED|RELEASED|FIXING_CI|AWAITING_REVIEW|RESOLVING|BLOCKED|NEEDS_HUMAN|NO_WORK> prs=<n> pr=<deciding-pr-url|-> reason="<one line>"` (tick verdict = worst severity across PRs). Autonomous resolve-pr runs end with `RESOLVE_PR_VERDICT=<RESOLVED|PENDING|NEEDS_HUMAN> threads=<n> fixed=<n> needs_human=<n>`, which land gates on. Distinct from a review receipt (Ralph's file-based proof-of-work): a verdict lives in the conversation output because `/goal` validators read the transcript, never the filesystem.

## Spec-as-PR

A team workflow where the spec is opened as a draft PR for review BEFORE any code lands. Reviewing a 50-line spec is higher-leverage than reviewing a 500-line implementation. Once merged, the spec is frozen on main; implementation PRs reference the merged spec.

## Frozen-at-handover

The R-ID invariant. Once a spec has been reviewed once, R5 means the same thing forever. A reviewer reading R5 in a six-month-old commit, a new team member reading R5 in the spec, and `/flow-next:make-pr` emitting R5 coverage all refer to the same acceptance criterion. Renumber-forbidden after first review cycle.

## flow-swarm

An in-progress companion product to flow-next that reads `.flow/specs/` directly to coordinate parallel agents across worktrees and consume `/flow-next:make-pr` output. The on-disk layout flow-swarm expects is what fn-43 (epic->spec rename) produces. Reference target for the v1.0 migration carrot.

## Tracker

An external issue tracker (Linear first, GitHub Issues next) that flow-next *projects* a spec to via `/flow-next:tracker-sync`. The tracker is a **co-editable mirror** — body, status, and comments sync two-way — but it is **projection, not coordination**: the `.flow/specs/<id>.md` spec stays the source of truth and the quality layer, and the tracker never drives flow state or spawns agents. Distinct from `/flow-next:sync` (plan-sync). Contrast OpenAI Symphony, where the tracker *is* the control plane.

## merge-base snapshot

The common-ancestor body the tracker-sync 3-way merge compares against — a **paired** snapshot taken at the last sync point: both a flow-form body and a tracker-form body, plus content hashes (the echo fence). Stored in the spec-JSON `tracker` block (`mergeBaseFlow` / `mergeBaseTracker` / `baseHashFlow` / `baseHashTracker`) and written atomically as a unit (a one-sided update is rejected, so neither half pins to a stale sync point). Advances with `lastSyncedAt` on a real reconcile, never on a no-op echo.

## discovery ceremony

The detect → surface → ask → never-assume flow `/flow-next:tracker-sync` runs before enabling the bridge. It probes four signals (Linear MCP, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, GitHub auth, a Jira host), surfaces what is present *and* absent, asks the user, and writes `tracker.*` config **only on confirmation**, with provenance. No signal ⇒ nothing written; the bridge stays off. Resolution model is env > config > ask (mirrors `flowctl review-backend`).

## tracker-key handle

A tracker identifier (e.g. `WOR-17`) used as a **resolvable flow id**, the hybrid id model. **Tracker-first** specs are canonically `wor-17-slug` (tasks `wor-17-slug.M`); bare `wor-17` / `wor-17.M` resolve as aliases. **Flow-first** specs keep `fn-NN-slug` and store `WOR-17` in `tracker.identifier` as a resolvable display alias. Resolution is case-insensitive (`show wor-17`, `work wor-17` resolve); the native `fn-` scheme is reserved (`fn-N` allocation counts `fn-*` only); one tracker team per repo; **ids never rename** on link.

## render lens

A regenerable human-review artifact (HTML) derived from a markdown source of truth; never the storage format, always re-derivable. flow-next ships two: the spec artifact and the PR artifact, both living at fixed deterministic paths under `.flow/artifacts/<spec-id>/` (never timestamped — Lavish keys annotation sessions on the absolute path). Every lens is self-contained single-file HTML (inline CSS/JS, zero external requests), carries a staleness stamp in its footer, and is never parsed back as state — regeneration always overwrites the same file.

## HTML artifact mode

The opt-in feature (2.0.0+) that makes participating skills (capture, plan, make-pr) emit render lenses alongside their markdown output. Activated via `flowctl config set artifacts.html.enabled true` (OFF by default, offered once by `/flow-next:setup`); when active, skills load the shared disclosure reference at `plugins/flow-next/references/html-artifacts.md` — the single carrier of all generation rules and the anti-slop design contract. With the mode off, skills load nothing extra: zero token cost, zero behavior change. Markdown and tracker-sync remain the sole source of truth.

## spec artifact

The spec's render lens at `.flow/artifacts/<spec-id>/spec.html`. ONE generation pathway with state-dependent rendering: spec-only view before tasks exist (capture workflow §5.10 — the business-review surface) and the added plan layer (task dependency DAG with critical path, R-ID → task coverage matrix) once tasks exist (plan Step 8.5 — after the refinement loop exits). Links back from the spec markdown via the idempotent `<!-- flow-next:artifact-link -->` marker line (replaced in place, repo-relative target). The only artifact that enters the Lavish annotate loop.

## PR artifact

The PR's render lens at `.flow/artifacts/<spec-id>/pr.html`, emitted by `/flow-next:make-pr` Phase 1.5. A **read-only review instrument**: diff-derived (never from commit messages), verified against the spec's R-ID export before publishing — mismatches render as visibly flagged rows, warn-in-artifact, never blocking. Committed narrowly (`chore(flow): pr artifact <spec-id>`, artifact file only) so the PR body's SHA-pinned blob link resolves; never enters the annotate loop — review conversation belongs to the code host.

## Lavish (lavish-axi)

An optional detect-on-PATH companion (npm: `lavish-axi`) for annotating spec artifacts in the browser — never wrapped, bundled, or required (same shape as clawpatch/`/flow-next:map`). Feedback is pull-only and session-spanning: annotations queue in the global `~/.lavish-axi/state.json` (not per-workspace), survive agent death, and any later agent session drains them via the `lavish-axi poll` CLI, mapping each annotation to a markdown-source edit followed by lens regeneration. Sessions key on the absolute artifact path (different worktrees = separate sessions); the local server idle-stops after ~30 min and `lavish-axi <file>` resumes it — absence or idle-stop is invisible because the artifact is a self-contained static page. Autonomous contexts never open a session and never poll.
